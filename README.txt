This is a free and opensource application to view the content
of dBase, FoxPro, and Visual FoxPro .dbf file.

You can download MS Windows version (binary and installation file) on:
http://www.mondial.co.id/products/simpledbfbrowser/

Supported Operating System
--------------------------
* Binary version can be run on MS Windows (tested on MS Windows7).
* Python script can be run on any operating system with Python and GTK+
  runtime installed.

We only provide binary build for MS Windows because we don't have
access to other operating system but MS Windows and Linux.

Building on other operating system should be easy. We are looking for
contributor to make a binary build on other operating system. If you
want to contribute and have an access to a Mac OS X or other operating
systems, please contact us at contact@mondial.co.id.
